# hello-world
My first github repository

Hi Guys! Margaux here 20 years old living in PH, aspiring to become a web developer. I'm almost done learning and experimenting with the fundamentals of html and css so i've decided to start learning and use git and github to become more efficient and productive with all this coding and learning that I need to do.
